# RBAC + ABAC Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) + Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** system for your real estate CRM platform. Here's what has been built:

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Database Layer**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL** with **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies
- ✅ **Prisma ORM** with comprehensive schema
- ✅ **Multi-tenant** organization support
- ✅ **Audit logging** for all sensitive operations

### **Backend Layer**
- ✅ **Express.js** API with JWT authentication
- ✅ **RBAC middleware** with role and permission checks
- ✅ **ABAC constraints** (ownership, tenancy, territory, status)
- ✅ **Rate limiting** and cooldown mechanisms

### **Frontend Layer**
- ✅ **React** components with role-aware UI
- ✅ **Authentication provider** with JWT token management
- ✅ **Role-based dashboards** and navigation
- ✅ **Buyer pool interface** with claim workflow

## 👥 **User Roles Implemented**

| Role | Description | Key Features |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **WEBSITE_ADMIN** | Platform owner/admin | Full system access, user management, impersonation |
| **CORP_OWNER** | Corporate account owner | Manage organization, agents, view org data |
| **CORP_AGENT** | Licensed agent under corporate | Manage properties, claim buyer requests, view org data |
| **INDIV_AGENT** | Independent licensed agent | Manage properties, claim buyer requests |
| **SELLER** | Individual property seller | Manage seller submissions, view own leads |
| **BUYER** | Individual property buyer | Manage buyer requests, view own claims |

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### **Authentication**
- JWT tokens with role claims
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management
- Admin impersonation capability

### **Authorization**
- Role-based permissions
- Organization-based access control
- Resource ownership validation
- Territory-based restrictions

### **Data Protection**
- Contact information masking
- Encrypted sensitive data
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Rate limiting and cooldowns

### **Database Security**
- Row-Level Security policies
- Encrypted connections
- Parameterized queries
- Access logging

## 🎯 **Buyer Pool & Claim Workflow**

### **How It Works**
1. **Buyers** create requests with masked contact information
2. **Agents** search the buyer pool (see masked contact only)
3. **Agents** claim buyer requests (exclusive 72-hour window)
4. **Full contact** details are revealed to claiming agent
5. **Leads** are automatically created for claimed requests
6. **Contact logs** are required for all outreach
7. **Claims expire** automatically or can be released manually

### **Rate Limits**
- **Max 5 active claims** per agent
- **Max 3 claims per buyer** per 24 hours
- **72-hour claim expiry** with auto-release
- **24-hour cooldown** between claims on same buyer

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **Core Entities**
- `users` - User accounts with roles and organization membership
- `organizations` - Corporate entities with licensing
- `agent_profiles` - Agent licensing and territory information
- `properties` - Real estate properties
- `listings` - Property listings (rent/sale)
- `buyer_requests` - Buyer requirements with masked contact
- `seller_submissions` - Seller property submissions
- `leads` - Sales leads from claims
- `claims` - Exclusive buyer request claims
- `contact_logs` - Agent outreach tracking
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail
- `file_assets` - File uploads with ownership

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **1. Setup Database**
```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-db.sh
```

### **2. Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **3. Access RBAC System**
- **Login Page**: `http://localhost:3000/rbac-login`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/rbac-dashboard`

## 🔑 **Test Accounts**

| Role | Email | Password | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Website Admin | admin@aqaraty.com | admin123 | Full system access |
| Corporate Owner | owner1@riyadh-realestate.com | owner123 | Manages Riyadh Real Estate |
| Corporate Agent | agent1@riyadh-realestate.com | agent123 | Works for Riyadh Real Estate |
| Individual Agent | indiv1@example.com | agent123 | Independent agent in Dammam |
| Seller | seller1@example.com | seller123 | Property seller |
| Buyer | buyer1@example.com | buyer123 | Property buyer |

## 📡 **API Endpoints**

### **Authentication**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/impersonate` - Admin impersonation
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

### **Buyer Pool**
- `GET /api/pool/buyers/search` - Search buyer requests (masked)
- `POST /api/pool/buyers/:id/claim` - Claim buyer request
- `POST /api/pool/buyers/:id/release` - Release claim
- `GET /api/pool/buyers/my-claims` - Get agent's active claims

## 🎨 **UI Components**

### **Authentication**
- `LoginForm` - Role-aware login with test accounts
- `AuthProvider` - JWT token management and role checking

### **Dashboard**
- `RoleBasedDashboard` - Different views based on user roles
- `BuyerPoolSearch` - Search and claim buyer requests
- `RBACDashboard` - Main dashboard with role-based navigation

## 🛡️ **Security Implementation**

### **PostgreSQL RLS Policies**
- User access policies
- Property access policies
- Buyer request policies
- Claim policies
- Lead policies

### **Server-side Guards**
- Role-based middleware
- Permission checking
- Organization scoping
- Resource ownership validation

### **Rate Limiting**
- Claim limits per agent
- Cooldown periods
- Automatic claim expiry
- Spam prevention

## 📈 **Monitoring & Auditing**

### **Audit Logs**
All sensitive operations are logged with:
- User ID and roles
- Action performed
- Entity and entity ID
- Before/after state
- IP address and user agent
- Timestamp

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Agent claims buyer request** → sees full contact → logs outreach → releases claim
2. **Corporate owner invites agent** → agent accepts → agent sees only org data
3. **Cross-tenant access attempt** → denied by API + RLS

## 📚 **Documentation**

- **README-RBAC.md** - Comprehensive system documentation
- **Database policies** - RLS policy explanations
- **API documentation** - Endpoint specifications
- **Security guide** - Implementation details

## 🎉 **What You Can Do Now**

1. **Login** with any test account to see role-based dashboards
2. **Search buyer pool** as an agent to see masked contact information
3. **Claim buyer requests** to reveal full contact details
4. **View different dashboards** based on your role
5. **Test multi-tenancy** by switching between corporate and individual accounts
6. **Audit all actions** through the comprehensive logging system

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. **Set up PostgreSQL** using the provided script
2. **Run the seed script** to populate sample data
3. **Test the system** with different user roles
4. **Customize** the UI and add more features as needed
5. **Deploy** to production with proper security configurations

**🎯 The RBAC + ABAC system is now fully implemented and ready for use!**

This implementation provides enterprise-grade security with role-based access control, multi-tenant support, and a sophisticated buyer pool workflow that protects contact information while enabling efficient lead management.
