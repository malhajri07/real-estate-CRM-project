# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The MENA real estate market needs a modern, Arabic-first CRM platform that understands the local market dynamics, cultural preferences, and business workflows. Traditional CRM systems are often LTR-first with Arabic as an afterthought, leading to poor user experiences.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Fragmented Property Management**
   - Agents struggle to manage listings across multiple platforms
   - No unified view of properties, leads, and customers
   - Solution: Centralized CRM with all tools in one place

2. **Inefficient Lead Management**
   - Manual lead tracking and follow-up
   - No systematic buyer pool management
   - Solution: Automated workflows and claim/release system

3. **Poor Arabic UX**
   - Most platforms are LTR-first with poor RTL support
   - Cultural misalignment in UI/UX patterns
   - Solution: RTL-first architecture with Arabic typography

4. **Lack of Analytics**
   - No visibility into business performance
   - Limited reporting capabilities
   - Solution: Comprehensive analytics platform with KPIs

5. **Content Management Challenges**
   - Marketing content requires developer intervention
   - No version control or approval workflows
   - Solution: Full CMS with draft/publish workflow
